## Corona Plugin Samples

This repository contains two samples to be used with the Together Plugin for Corona

### Sample-Memory

This is the simplest example with only the minimum requirements included for getting your game on Together. If you are new to using the Together platform, this is the
suggested starting place. After you have familiarized yourself with the features shown in this example, and wish to take on more advanced features for your game, then 
move on to the TicTacToe project which showcases those features.

### Sample-TicTacToe

This is the more advanced sample showcasing features such as Facebook integration and Push Services. If you already have your game functioning and wish to add advanced features 
to it such as this, then looking through this sample should show how these can be integrated. If you are looking to just get started as quickly as possible, then it is 
suggested to take a look at the Memory game sample first.
